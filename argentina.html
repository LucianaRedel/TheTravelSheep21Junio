                <p> I am a native Argentinian citizen, and I can tell you we might have the richest country in the world
                    in
                    terms of nature and diversity: we have a vast territory with so many different landscapes, from
                    mountains to desserts, waterfalls, green fields, jungle, glacier, and beaches. In winter, we have
                    cold
                    weather and snow in the south of the country, and warm sunny days in the north. Nature is beautiful

                        There are so many beautiful places to visit in these two provinces, and if you want to get to
                        know it
                        all, you will need to spend at least ten days around there to enjoy it and get the best out of
                        your
                        trip.
                        There are basically two ways of touring around, one is choosing one of the so many tour company
                        options,
                        and the other one, is renting a car and doing it by your own. It will depend on your budget and
                        on your
                        personal preferences and needs. However, you will also need to take into consideration that some
                        routes
                        going up are almost desserts and without internet signal, like the one to get to San Martin de

                        Cobres to ride the Tren de las nubes.

                        around, and
                        you should also take into consideration that the reflection of the sun is blinding, and you will

                        areas and follows the line of a major cultural route, the Camino Inca, along the spectacular
                        valley of
                        the Rio Grande. The Gorge is 2939 meters above ocean level, reason why it is recommended to walk
                        with
                        slowness, to avoid the unpleasant symptoms of the “apunamiento”, a malaise caused by the
                        diminution of
                        oxygen. The thermal amplitude is very vast: 38ºC by day and -10º C at night. Anticipate this
                        when
                        deciding what clothes you will take

                    Iguazu waterfall is one of the seven natural wonders of the world and one of the most imposing
                    natural attractions on Earth. It is located in the north of the province of Misiones. The
                    recommendation would be to stay a couple of days to get to know the most interesting places around
                    and have some adventures in the jungle
                </p>

                    <h4 class="scale">Some things to do here:</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Walking on the footbridge, from the visitor’s center, you have two circuits to follow, the upper
                    path and the lower path. Both are different but worth it, just walk around and enjoy the panoramic
                    views in an unforgettable experience
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Have an adventure discovering one of the walking paths through the dense jungle, where live
                    almost 500 species of mammals and an immense variety of reptiles, fish, insects, and butterflies
                    live in this ecosystem
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Enjoying a nautical trip along the Iguazú river is a different way to get to know the jungle with
                    a humid subtropical climate that borders the rivers coasts with its lush foliage
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. National Park Salto Encantado, it ocuppies an area of almost 14 thousand hectares. There had been
                    many legends about this place and its magical, religious and even extraordinay attributes. It is
                    perfect for adventure travellers and specially for those who enjoy hiking
                </p>

                <p>The season when you chose to travel here, winter or summer, it will depend on what you want to do and
                    on your personal preferences, in spring and summer the landscape is green and full of flowers and
                    colors, and in winter you will find snow everywhere and short days, since it gets dark early in the
                    afternoon. From my opinion, visiting in summer and visiting in winter are both worth to travel.

                    An important advice, just keep in mind that telephone signal is lost during most of the road trip

                                It will mainly depend on many things, such as your budget, the duration of your stay,
                                the kind of experience you are looking for, if you are in a group or in a solo trip, the
                                weather in your destination, the size of the city you are visiting, and so on.

                                You can choose among a Hotel, a Hostel, an apartment or even a room. Here are some tips
                                to help you decide, take into consideration the comments of previous guest, search the
                                reputation of your expected host or hotel, check on the neighborhood you are planning to
                                stay at, find out traveling extra costs you could need to afford is you plan to stay in
                                a
                                faraway place, and in this case, you could maybe even consider renting a car and
                                evaluate it cost. You should also review the booking and payment terms of course, and
                                consider the exchange rate. One last thing you might consider,
                                it is if this is your first time there or if you are returning to an old destination
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you visit the city of Buenos Aires, some good
                                neighborhoods you can choose are Palermo, Belgrano and Recoleta; the location is good
                                and safe enough.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, while doing this evaluation, you may find that you lean to one destination even
                                though
                                the facts point to another. Remember, the final decision about the right travel
                                destination for you is yours to make, no one else’s!

                                A trip to Argentina is almost always associated with eating and drinking and you
                                certainly cannot leave the country without enjoying fantastic wines and food from
                                Argentina, ideally at every meal. Argentinian gastronomy is the result of its mixed
                                heritage which draws from Spanish, Italian and Portuguese colonization.
                            </p>

                                Walking around Buenos Aires you may feel like you are among the bistros of Paris, or in
                                a neighbourhood of Milan or Madrid. This multicultural, but also markedly European feel,
                                is also reflected in the food.

                                Although Argentina is a beautiful country, there are some safety points to mention,
                                especially if you are visiting big cities: take care of your belongings everywhere you
                                go, do not venture by yourself to dangerous neighborhoods, try to avoid walking along
                                holding your camera or your cellphone, do not be scared, but just being alert will
                                surely help you to enjoy your experience there.
