                    I am not fan of those pre-arranged trips that take you all over Europe in two weeks. You just can
                    not see it all, you cannot get to experience anything at all rushing from one place to another. And
                    I am sure it will leave you the sense of not having enjoyed neither discovered Europe.

                        How to travel around England? Taking the train is undoubtedly the best option to move from one
                        city to another in a fast and safe way. Another option to consider and depending on your
                        personal preferences will be to rent a car and experience the British routes by yourself. Just
                        one important comment, take into consideration they drive on the left, and that can be confusing
                        if you are not used to.

                            <span class="negrita"> Manchester </span> is a major city in the northwest of England with a
                            rich industrial heritage. The Castlefield conservation area’s 18th-century canal system
                            recalls the city’s days as a textile powerhouse, and visitors can trace this history at the
                            interactive Museum of Science & Industry. Manchester was right at the heart of the
                            Revolution, becoming the UK's leading producer of
                            cotton and textiles. Manchester is also famous for being the first industrialised city in
                            the world. Manchester was responsible for the country's first ever working canal in 1761 and
                            the world's first ever railway line in 1830
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Youthful, diverse, energetic and bursting with character; Manchester is one of the most
                            exciting places to visit in the UK right now where everybody and anybody is very warmly
                            welcomed.
                            Known throughout the world as the birthplace of the industrial revolution, Manchester has a
                            proud history in science, politics, music, arts and sport. And today the city combines this
                            heritage with a progressive vision to be a city that delivers surprise and delight in equal
                            measures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Manchester city centre is jam-packed with unique and eclectic restaurants, bars, shops,
                            museums, galleries, hotels and places to stay whilst the surrounding Greater Manchester
                            boroughs offer a patch-work of visitor experiences including quaint market towns,
                            traditional pubs and beautiful green spaces and waterways to be explored on foot or bike.
                            The city region is easily navigated, with great transport links both in and around Greater
                            Manchester.

                        laneways, shops, over 2500 listed buildings and world-class museums. The history of Liverpool is
                        long and exciting because of its importance as a port city.

                        Although is a small city in terms of size and population, there are plenty of interesting
                        attractions and activities to enjoy. With 3 major universities in Liverpool, there is a young
                        and optimistic spirit here, along with plenty of options, probably staying two nights here is

                        <span class="negrita"> Edinburgh </span> Is Scotland's compact, hilly capital. It has a medieval
                        Old Town and elegant Georgian New Town with gardens and neoclassical buildings. Looming over the
                        city is Edinburgh Castle, home to Scotland’s crown jewels and the Stone of Destiny, used in the
                        coronation of Scottish rulers. Arthur’s Seat is an imposing peak in Holyrood Park with sweeping
                        views, and Calton Hill is topped with monuments and memorials.

                        Edinburgh is known for being one of the most beautiful cities in the world, its historic
                        attractions, UNESCO World Heritage sites, and rich history. Widely considered the world's best
                        festival city, it's a powerhouse for the literary arts, comedy, culture, high education, and
                        more

                        Its proximity to the sea mitigatestemperature extremes. Winters are relatively warm, with
                        average daily minimum temperatures remaining above freezing, while summers are comparatively
                        cool, with temperatures seldom rising much above 70 °F (21 °C).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Edinburgh lacks prolonged sunshine: on average it annually receives less than one-third of the
                        possible sunshine for its latitude. But its ever-changing cloudscape partly compensates for
                        this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The city is served by Abellio ScotRail, the regional rail carrier. There is frequent train
                        service to London and the major Scottish cities as well as regular service to other parts of
                        Scotland and England. Edinburgh has two central railway stations: Waverley (the second largest
                        in Britain) and Haymarket.

                <p>This is a country with a long Mediterranean coastline, and it has left a powerful mark on Western
                    culture and cuisine. Its capital, Rome, is home to the Vatican as well as landmark art and ancient
                    ruins. Other major cities include Florence, with Renaissance masterpieces such as Michelangelo’s
                    "David" and Brunelleschi's Duomo; Venice, the city of canals; and Milan, Italy’s fashion capital.

                    <span class="negrita"> Rome </span> With its ancient history, artistic beauty and neighborhoods to
                    visit on foot, Rome, the Eternal City and capital of Italy, is a unique experience full of charm. It
                    offers almost three thousand years of history, from museums and monuments to neighborhoods where you
                    can breathe in the true Roman spirit, the Eternal City is a center of culture and leisure with
                    undeniable charm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The historical center, the Tiber, the Colosseum, the Vatican, the narrow streets, and the
                    Sampietrini: Rome is a work of art, a perfect design created by artists, men of culture, commanders
                    and peoples who have made it great. It is both ancient and modern at the same time, full of
                    attractions to experience and visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One reason to visit Rome is its uniqueness. Its almost three thousand years of history have made it
                    what it is today, an ancient metropolis in a modern era, where the historical and archaeological
                    heritage is in harmony with the urban fabric. Some places in the capital are among the 58 Italian
                    sites included on the UNESCO World Heritage List; these are the historic center with the
                    extraterritorial properties of the Holy See and the Papal Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls.

                        <span class="negrita"> Florence </span> Florence is a city whose charm and splendid past have
                        remained unaltered. The beating heart of Florence is Piazza del Duomo, with its monumental
                        complex of the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore surmounted by Brunelleschi's majestic dome; the
                        San Giovanni or St. John’s Baptistry, a magnificent example of the Florentine Romanesque; and
                        Giotto’s Campanile or Bell Tower, a Florentine Gothic architectural master work
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Behind the Duomo stands the Museo dell’Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore, with various works from
                        the Cathedral on display; visitors can admire pieces intended for all the structures of the
                        complex, from the Baptistry to the Bell Tower.
                        Piazza della Signoria represents the historical hub of civil and political life, and hosts the
                        13th-Century Loggia dei Lanzi, the Fountain of Neptune and the Palazzo della Signoria or Palazzo
                        Vecchio, one of the city’s most symbolic monuments. In front of the Palazzo, statues, including
                        a copy of Michelangelo’s famous David, stand tall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next to the Piazza is the marvelous Uffizi Gallery, home to one of the most important museums in
                        the entire world, hosting works by Botticelli, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and numerous
                        other master artists. A remarkable architectonic element of the Uffizi Gallery is the Vasari
                        Corridor, realized by Giorgio Vasari himself around the mid-Fifteenth Century; the Corridor
                        connects the Gallery to the Palazzo Vecchio and Palazzo Pitti.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Crossing the very old and suggestive Ponte Vecchio, with its storied gold workshops, one arrives
                        in the Oltrarno quarter to encounter the scenographic piazza that gives way to Palazzo Pitti, an
                        imposing, sumptuous palace where resided the Medici and Lorena clans. The Pitti boasts a
                        wondrous park, the glorious Boboli Gardens; the Gardens are an exemplar of Italian garden
                        landscaping
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also in the Oltrarno neighborhood, the panoramic Piazzale Michelangelo, a favorite tourist
                        haunt, rewards visitors with a gorgeous view of Florence and the surrounding hills; while the
                        Church of San Miniato al Monte is one of the best products of the Florentine Romanesque.

                        <span class="negrita"> Venice </span> Unique and captivating, with channels that continually
                        change
                        a scenario unlike any other in the world. Venice’s beating heart is Piazza San Marco, Europe’s
                        most
                        elegant living room, which is surrounded by works of indisputable mastery and prestige: the
                        imposing
                        Campanile Bell Tower, and the Basilica with its five portals and decorations in marble and
                        mosaics
                        hinting at the pomp and extravagance of the interior; the Palazzo Ducale, the Moors’ Tower,
                        famously
                        known as the Clock Tower, given the highly-evolved engineering that for centuries has marked the
                        time for Venice; and the Ala Napoleonica housing the Museo Correr.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Several historic cafes yield onto the piazza. Not to be overlooked is the marvellous Caffè
                        Florian: opened in 1720, it is the oldest cafe in Italy. The elegant interiors are remarkable
                        for their use of stucco, their paintings and mirrors. And among the illustrious clientele that
                        sat at Florian’s tables throughout the centuries
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Venetians say that the best way to know their fantastic city is to take any calle (path,
                        road) and walk it with your “nose in the air.” That way you can observe everything in front of
                        you without consulting a map, and without missing a beat; don’t be afraid to get lost, as the
                        enchanting paths will always take you back… to Piazza San Marco!

                    <p>
                        Keep walking over the Bridge of Sighs to enjoy a breathtaking view of the lagoon, one arrives in
                        the Castello sestiere (neighborhood). Castello abounds with architectural and artistic jewels
                        like the Churches of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and of San Zaccaria, and the Church of San
                        Giovanni in Bragora, considered by many to be one of the most beautiful in the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Peggy Guggenheim Collection is also a huge must; located inside the Palazzo Venier dei
                        Leoni, it holds important artworks from the 20th Century. Continuing in the same direction, one
                        finds other important museums: the Gallerie dell'Accademia, inside the majestic complex of the
                        Scuola Grande de la Carità, which also comprises the homonymous church and monastery; and Ca’
                        Rezzonico, one of the most awe-inspiring palaces from the Renaissance and location for the
                        Museum of 18th Century Venice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Around Venice itself lie the more than one hundred other islands making up this lagoon city –
                        the predominant ones being Burano, world-famous for its lace; Murano and its glass production;
                        Pellestrina, characterized by sandy dunes and reed groves; and Torcello, one of the oldest human
                        settlements in the area.

                        <span class="negrita"> Cinque Terre </span> This is a string of centuries-old seaside villages
                        on the rugged Italian Riviera coastline. In each of the 5 towns, colorful houses and vineyards
                        cling to steep terraces, harbors are filled with fishing boats and trattorias turn out seafood
                        specialties along with the Liguria region’s famous sauce, pesto. The Sentiero Azzurro cliffside
                        hiking trail links the villages and offers sweeping sea views.

                    <p>
                        The Cinque Terre is noted for its beauty. Over centuries, people have carefully built terraces
                        to cultivate grapes and olives on the rugged, steep landscape right up to the cliffs that
                        overlook the Mediterranean Sea.

                    In France, tourism is a major industry. France is the world's leading tourist destination.
                    As a country, France offers a fabulous historic heritage and probably the most diversified natural
                    environment of any country in Europe. Its tourist attractions illustrate the history of the human
                    race, from the prehistoric sites of Cro Magnon to the steel and glass of the Futuroscope; they
                    include fine vestiges of all European civilisations, from the prehistoric megaliths of Carnac and
                    the Roman remains of Provence, through medieval castles and cathedrals, to the splendours of
                    Versailles, the nineteenth century Eiffel Tower, or the resolute modernity of the TGV.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="negrita"> Paris </span> Is a city with a proud and very ancient history. Originally
                    founded in the third century BC, on an island in the middle of the Seine, it was the capital city of
                    a tribe known as the Parisii, who gave it their name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the early Middle Ages, West Francia became France, and Paris grew in importance as a European
                    city. By the 12th century, whenNotre Dame cathedral was built on the largest of the islands in the
                    Seine, Paris was the capital of one of the most powerful kingdoms in Europe and its importance as an
                    international city has never waned.
                    Many of the great buildings of Paris, such as the Louvre and the Panthéon, date from the 17th and
                    18th centuries when royal power in France was at its peak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like most French cities, Paris is not a place to visit by car. Parking can be an expensive nightmare
                    (though less so than London), and the city has a great public transport network, with a fast
                    underground or subway network that stretches well into the suburbs
                </p>
                <p>
                    When visiting Paris, if you plan to use the metro or the bus from time to time but less than six
                    times in a day, opt for a "carnet" (pronounced Car-nay). This is simply ten standard tickets at a
                    reduced rate, and can be bought from the ticket dispensing machines at any metro station, from
                    ticket offices at those metro stations that have them, and from other Paris transport offices.
                    Carnet tickets have no date limit, and can be shared among members of a group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paris offers the largest concentration of tourist attractions in France, and possibly in Europe.
                    Besides some of the world's most famous musuems, its has a vibrant historic city centre, a beautiful
                    riverscape, an extensive range of historic monuments, including cathedrals, chapels and palaces,
                    plus one of the most famous nightlife scenes in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paris is also famous for its cafés and restaurants, its theatres and cinemas, and its general
                    ambiance.

                        <strong> a. The Louvre, </strong> one of the world's great art galleries, with masterpieces such
                        as the Mona Lisa
                        (which is known in French as La Joconde), and works by almost all the greatest painters. The

                    <span class="negrita"> Portugal </span> is a small country with much to see and do, making it
                    relatively easy to explore. From the cosmopolitan city of Lisbon to the traditional villages,
                    visitors will find a diverse range of travel options. If you are traveling in the summer there are
                    many beaches to enjoy, but the cultural and architectural attractions are a draw for tourists year
                    round.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are numerous day trip options from Lisbon, but one of the main sightseeing destinations is the
                    town of Sintra. Set in the hills outside of Lisbon, this town is centered around the Palacio
                    Nacional de Sintra, with its cone shaped towers. From here it's easy to explore a number of
                    interesting sights, including the fairy-tale-like Palacio de Pena and the ruins of Castelo dos
                    Mouros. During the summer months the Costa do Sol is another popular area near Lisbon known for its
                    beach resorts. Sun seekers will find no shortage of things to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Equally impressive, in its own unique way, is the city of Porto. The old town is picturesquely set
                    on a hillside overlooking the River Douro. The Riberia area, with its colorfully painted houses, is
                    one of the city's main tourist attractions. Around the Praça da Ribeira small shops and restaurants
                    have set up in old restored houses. There are also many possible excursions from Porto.

                    To me, Switzerland deserves a special mention. I have always felt something about this small
                    country, since being a little girl. To star with, my family lived closed to a Swiss woman, and I
                    recall doing a school project about Swiss's cantons, and for some other personal's reasons, I still
                    feel something special about this country. It was my last trip destinations, before the pandemic,
                    two weeks visiting its cities, and I can assure you, it has been a very special trip.

                        quarters, with landmarks like capital Bern’s Zytglogge clock tower and Lucerne’s wooden chapel
                        bridge. The country is also known for its ski resorts and hiking trails. Banking and finance are
                        key industries, and Swiss watches and chocolate are world renowned

                    <h4 class="scale"> Some ideas about what to do around? </h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 1.The Matterhorn, </strong> The Matterhorn, Switzerland's iconic pointed peak is one of
                        the highest mountains in the Alps. On the border with Italy, this legendary peak rises to 4,478
                        meters, and its four steep faces lie in the direction of the compass points. The first summiting
                        in 1865 ended tragically when four climbers fell to their death during the descent. Today,
                        thousands of experienced climbers come here each summer.

                        <strong> 2. Jungfraujoch: The Top of Europe, </strong> The longest glacier in Europe, the Great
                        Aletsch Glacier begins at Jungfraujoch, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The famous Eiger
                        Trail from the Eiger glacier station to Alpiglen clings to the rocks at the foot of the north
                        face.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 3. Lauterbrunnen Valley and Grindelwald, </strong> These two villages will surely take
                        your breath away. It nestles at the base of
                        snow-cloaked mountains and is one of Switzerland's oldest and most popular resorts. Towering
                        above this alpine valley is the tiara-shaped Wetterhorn and the sheer north face of the Eiger,
                        one of the planet's most dramatic and difficult climbs. Between the mountains lie Grindelwald's
                        two glinting glaciers

                        <strong> 4. Interlaken, </strong> Situated between Lake Thun to the west and Lake Brienz to the
                        east, Interlaken is one of Switzerland's most popular summer holiday resorts. In the center of
                        town, Höhematte is a marvel of urban planning with 35 acres of open space. Flower gardens,
                        hotels, and cafés surround the Höheweg, the main boulevard through here with breathtaking vistas
                        of the mountains.

                        <strong> 5. Lucerne, </strong> Such a beautiful city, one of the city's most famous landmarks is
                        the Chapel Bridge, built in the 14th century. In a small park, lies the famous Lion Monument, a
                        poignant sculpture of a dying lion, which honors the heroic death of Swiss Guards during the
                        attack on the Tuileries in the French Revolution.

                        <strong> 6. Lake Geneva, </strong> Europe's largest Alpine lake, straddles the Swiss/French
                        border, and laps at the shores of some of Switzerland's most popular cities. The city of Geneva
                        (in French Genève; in German Genf) sits between pretty snowcapped peaks at the point where the
                        Rhône spills into Lake Geneva. The Jet d'Eau, a fountain in Lake Geneva shooting water 150
                        meters into the air, is a famous landmark. Cultural attractions include the Opera House and the
                        Grand Théâtre, which stages international acts.

                        <strong> 7. Chateau de Chillon, Montreux, </strong> There is a beautiful river path to get to
                        the Chateau, you have to start your walking adventure in Montreaux. The Chillon Castle has
                        inspired artists and
                        writers for centuries. Lord Byron, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Victor Hugo are among the
                        luminaries who have written about this architectural treasure.

                    <p>
                        <strong> 8. St. Moritz, </strong> Mirror-like lakes, glaciers, jagged peaks, alpine forests, and
                        oodles of sunshine make St. Moritz one of the world's top mountain destinations and a must-visit
                        on your list of things to do in Switzerland. Palatial hotels and pricey restaurants are par for
                        the course at this chic resort town, which has hosted two winter Olympics.

                        <strong> 9. Bern, </strong> In a stunning location, perched on a peninsula of the River Aare,
                        the Swiss capital of Bern exudes old-world charm, and the city's medieval old town is a UNESCO
                        World Heritage Site

                    <p>
                        <strong> 10. Lake Lugano and Ticino, </strong> In the towns around Lake Lugano and Lake Maggiore
                        to the west, the feel of Italy is unmistakable in the architecture, the piazzas, and the passion
                        for fine food, which spills over the Italian borders from the south, east, and west. In
                        Bellinzona, capital of the canton, three magnificent castles are UNESCO World Heritage sites.

                        <strong> 11. Zurich, </strong> This is Switzerland's largest city, a major transportation hub,
                        and a top starting point for travelers. The city lies at the northwestern end of Lake Zurich
                        astride the river Limmat. Beyond its buttoned-up façade, this affluent banking capital boasts a
                        rich line-up of cultural treasures. A short stroll from Zürich's main station, the Swiss
                        National Museum, in a Gothic chateau, spotlights Swiss cultural history
                    </p>

                        <strong> 12. The Rhine Falls, </strong> Spanning 150 meters, the Rhine Falls (Rheinfall) at
                        Schaffhausen are the largest falls in Central Europe. The best time to visit is during June and
                        July when the mountain snow melts, and the falls swell in volume to spill over a 21-meter-high
                        ledge of Jurassic limestone.

                        <strong> 13. The Albula/Bernina Railway Line, </strong> One of the very few railway lines in the
                        world designated as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage listing, the Albula/Bernina line on the
                        Rheatian Railways offers a majestic ride not to be missed. The route extends throughout the
                        Albula and Bernina landscapes, covering 122 kilometers and winding through almost 200 bridges,
                        the Graubünden mountains, and a number of tunnels and viaducts along the way.

                        <strong> 14. Oberhofen Castle, </strong> Right on the shore of Lake Thun and surrounded by a
                        2.5-hectare park, this 13th-century castle is one of the most breathtaking in Switzerland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 15. Gruyères, </strong> Even if you don't know anything about this small medieval town,
                        you've probably heard about the hard yellow cheese that made its name famous. Today, that's one
                        of the town's main attractions. Visitors can tour a cheese factory, sample the local
                        specialties, and wave to the cows that call the surrounding green hills home

                        <span class="negrita"> The Netherlands,</span> Is known for a flat landscape of canals, tulip
                        fields, windmills and cycling routes. Amsterdam, the capital, is home to the Rijksmuseum, Van
                        Gogh Museum and the house where Jewish diarist Anne Frank hid during WWII. Canalside mansions
                        and a trove of works from artists including Rembrandt and Vermeer remain from the city's
                        17th-century "Golden Age."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other places to visit include numerous medieval castles and cityscapes, along with a 13,800-acre
                        national park, and a tide control system that's been named one of the Seven Wonders of the
                        Modern World.

                        Many of the top travel destinations and major cities in the Netherlands actively encourage the
                        use of pedal-power and provide free bikes to explore the sights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> One important recommendation, Beware the bicycles all over The Netherlands! </strong>

                    <h4 class="scale"> Things to do around here </h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 1. Jordaan and Amsterdam's Canals, </strong> Canals are as important a part of
                        Amsterdam's cityscape as they are to the city of Venice, and some of the most enduring memories
                        for any visitor are the time spent exploring the city's wonderful waterways. Particularly
                        charming is the Jordaan, a neighborhood built in the early 1600s to house workers and immigrants
                        drawn here for the city's religious tolerance
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>2. Dam Square</strong> This is a must-visit when in Amsterdam. In
                        addition to
                        its numerous restaurants, cafés, and shops this vast public square is home to some of the city's
                        most-visited tourist attractions. These include the spectacular Royal Palace (Koninklijk
                        Palace); the attractive New Church (Nieuwe Kerk); and the country's most important war memorial,
                        the National Memorial Statue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 3. Keukenhof, </strong> And one of the most beautiful places to visit
                        in the Netherlands showcases these and other spring bulbs in spectacular abundance. Given its
                        handy location relative to Amsterdam, it's a 45-minute drive away, or just under an hour by
                        public transit, and it makes for a fun and easy day trip from the country's largest city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 4. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, </strong> Apart from its unique collection of old masters,
                        this spectacular museum offers an exhaustive account of the development of art and culture in
                        The Netherlands and is especially rich in traditional Dutch handicrafts, medieval sculpture, and
                        modern art. Be prepared to spend the best part of a day exploring this museum's
                        endless treasures
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 5. Historic Binnenhof, The Hague</strong> Known the world over as the location of the
                        International Court of Justice, The Hague (Den Haag) is also the political center of The
                        Netherlands. The Hague also makes for an excellent travel destination for visitors wanting to
                        get a taste of the country's rich history
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 6. Anne Frank House, Amsterdam </strong> The back of the fully-restored house where the
                        Frank family had their hiding place has been kept in its original state as much as possible and
                        is a poignant monument to a tragic slice of world history and a brave young woman who continues
                        to inspire people around the globe
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 7. Oude Haven, Rotterdam, </strong> Located an easy one-hour train ride from Amsterdam,
                        the port city of Rotterdam is well worth visiting for its well-preserved Old Harbour, or Oude
                        Haven. The city has a long and rich maritime history thanks largely to its location on the
                        Nieuwe Maas, an arm of the Rhine river, and its proximity to the English Channel. This is ideal
                        for
                        those who enjoy seeing the sights on foot
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 8. Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, </strong> Home to the world's largest collection of Van
                        Gogh paintings, many donated by the artist's family, this impressive gallery and museum was
                        specially built to showcase the more than 200 paintings, 500 drawings, and 700 letters in its
                        vast collection.

                    <p>
                        <strong> 9. The Windmills of Kinderdijk, </strong>The big draw these days are the fantastically
                        preserved 18th-century windmills. Now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the 19 Kinderdijk windmills,
                        built between 1722 and 1761, are the largest surviving concentration of windmills in the
                        Netherlands
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 10. Cathedral Square, Utrecht, </strong> A popular tourist destination for its many
                        fine historic buildings, the Dutch city of Utrecht should definitely be included on your
                        Netherlands travel itinerary.

                    <p>
                        <strong> 11. The Ijsselmeer (Zuiderzee), </strong> These towns flourished during Amsterdam's
                        Golden Age, when they had access to the Atlantic and prospered as fishing and trade centers, but
                        lost importance as the harbors silted up.
                        Today, they're among the most photographed tourist attractions in the country. Time seems to
                        have stood still for the fishing village of Marken and the seaports of Volendam and Enkhuizen,
                        where many of the colorful houses have become museums and shops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 12. Historic Valkenburg, </strong> Long a popular holiday resort, the town's other big
                        draws are its many caves and the spa facilities at Thermae 2000, one of the largest such
                        establishments in the Netherlands.

                        (and therefore easy to get to), Delft is known the world over for its famous blue and white
                        porcelain products

                        Dutch-speaking Flanders to the north, French-speaking Wallonia to the south and a
                        German-speaking community to the east. The bilingual capital, Brussels, has ornate guildhalls at
                        Grand-Place and elegant art-nouveau buildings
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although Bruges is by far Belgium's most popular place to visit, plenty of other towns in the
                        country, particularly Ghent and Mechelen, retain excellent architectural examples from the
                        Middle Ages as well.

                    <p>
                        <strong> 1. Grand Place, Brussels, </strong> Grand Place was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site
                        for its outstanding representation of late 17th-century architecture.
                        The square is busy with tourists and locals at all times of year, but especially in August of
                        alternate years, when the center is filled with the 75, by 24-meter flower carpet, made up of
                        more than 700,000 cut begonias
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 2. The Canals of Bruges, </strong> Today, the canals are beautiful reminders of Bruges
                        history, and taking a sightseeing cruise along them is one of the most popular ways to explore
                        the city.
                        Sightseeing boat trips, departing from five docks, dotted along the main canal in the central
                        city, run half-hourly from March to November (and less frequently in the depths of winter) with
                        trips winding down the length of the main canal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 3. The Battlefields of Flanders, </strong> Not only important historically, the
                        battlefields are a major pilgrimage site. The preserved trenches run for kilometers around the
                        town of Ypres, while this area is also scattered with vast cemeteries for the thousands of
                        soldiers who died here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 4. The Belfry of Bruges, </strong> Dating from the 13th century, this medieval era
                        tower
                        is attached to a building that once functioned as the main town market hall and has been
                        wonderfully preserved, allowing visitors a real taste of the architectural might of the Middle
                        Ages.

                    <p>
                        <strong> 5. Ghent's Gravensteen and Old Town, </strong> This hugely impressive fort was once the
                        grand home of the counts of Flanders, who took their inspiration for castle-building from the
                        bulky castles the Crusaders built in Syria. Inside, the vast arched halls and chambers contain
                        exhibits of medieval life, but it's the castle's architecture itself that is the real star of
                        the show
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 6. Basilica of the Holy Blood, Bruges, </strong> If you're only going to visit one
                        church in Bruges make it this one. The Basilica of the Holy Blood is not only impressive for its
                        blending of Romanesque and late Gothic architecture but also for the sacred relic kept inside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 7. Meuse Valley, </strong> The Meuse River offers Belgium's most scenic river trip
                        opportunities, with dense forest countryside interspersed with hilltop craggy castle and
                        fortress ruins, and little waterfront towns backed by limestone cliffs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 8. Mechelen Old Town, </strong> Its monuments may not be as famous as those in visitor
                        favorite Bruges, but Mechelen's old town area is a great place to capture a sense of medieval
                        Belgium, with plenty of gabled architecture and fine old buildings still in situ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 9. Waterloo, </strong> The place where Napoleon was defeated in the famous battle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> 10. Semois Valley, </strong> Here, in the southern corner of the country, the winding
                        Semois River cuts through farmland overlooked by gently undulating forest-clad hills. It's
                        Belgium's prime hiking territory and also a good place for riverboat trips following the sinuous
                        curves of the river.

                        new surprises. From historical sights to cutting edge architecture and culture, this city has it
                        all. Below you can find some of the most popular and exciting attractions in the city, but don’t

                        Berlin nightlife is renowned for its excitement and eccentricity. This is a city that seldom
                        sleeps, with most clubs not even getting busy until 1am, so be sure not to head out too early.

                    <p>
                        <strong> 1. Brandenburg Gate, </strong> One of the most iconic sights in the world, this
                        neoclassical monument needs to be seen to be believed. The best time to visit the Brandenburg
                        Gate is at night, when stunning illumination will help you capture a picture postcard shot
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>2. Berlin wall, </strong> No visit to Berlin can be completed without a trip to the site
                        of the remaining Berlin wall. From 1961 to 1989 this imposing structure split the city in two,
                        both physically and ideologically, separating West and East Germany. Surprisingly there is very
                        little left standing of the wall today, though remnants are dotted throughout the city.

                        <strong> 3. Checkpoint Charlie</strong>

                        picture taken with actors dressed in US military garb. While the attraction can be ticked off
                        your bucket list in 10 minutes or so, it remains an important part of the city’s history and
                        should not be missed.

                                <strong> 4. Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, </strong>Located on Vienna's outskirts, the
                                Baroque Schönbrunn Palace was completed in the early 1700s and was later converted into
                                a summer residence by Empress Maria Theresa. Your visit to Schönbrunn should include the
                                many attractions spread throughout these grounds: formal gardens; a labyrinth; the Palm
                                House, filled with tropical and exotic plants and butterflies; an Alpine garden with a
                                farmhouse; Europe's oldest zoo; and the Classical Gloriette, a grand marble structure

                                <strong>5. Innsbruck's Hofburg and Hofkirche, </strong>The Emperor Maximilian I, who
                                reigned in the late 1400s and early 1500s, made Innsbruck the main residence and the
                                seat of the Hapsburg government and, as a result, a focal point of Europe. His palace,
                                the Hofburg, was remodeled by Empress Maria Theresa in 18th-century Baroque and Rococo
                                styles. Highlights of a tour are the chance to view the sumptuous royal apartments, the
                                marble Giant Hall (Riesensaal), and the painted ceilings throughout.

                                one of the most picturesque small towns in Austria, if not Europe. It's also a good
                                place from which to explore the spectacular Dachstein Salzkammergut region, a UNESCO

                                <strong> Charles Bridge, </strong> Charles bridge is one of the most beautiful bridge in
                                Europe if not the most beautiful one..
                                Whoever said that “the best things in life are free” may well have been referring to the
                                Charles Bridge in Prague. A simple walk across the 14th Century bridge is one of the
                                most enjoyable and memorable experiences of visiting Prague. The bridge was commissioned
                                in 1357 by Charles IV to replace an older bridge that had been washed away by floods.
                                Although completed in 1390, with the striking statues added in the 17th century, the
                                bridge did not take Charles’ name until the 19th century.

                                <strong> Golden lane, </strong> Also located within the grounds of the castle is the
                                mysterious Golden Lane, so called because, according to legends, alchemists had to look
                                on this street to find a reaction to turn ordinary materials into gold. Despite the
                                streets name, it is debated whether alchemists ever worked or lived here. Czech-Jewish
                                writer Franz Kafka used a house on the street for around two years as he enjoyed the
                                peaceful environment it provided whilst writing.

                                The Beatles graffiti, lyrics and quotations since the 1980s and is very popular among
                                tourists and young fans wishing to pay homage to the group

                                <strong> Puppets shops, </strong>The city has over 20 specialised puppet shops, 30
                                puppet makers and even a puppet museum. The Czech love affair with puppets probably
                                dates back to the 12th Century when the figures were used as entertainment at royal
                                feasts and ceremonies.

                        I am positively sure it is so much better just to choose one, two or even three destinations to
                        visit, to know, to fully enjoy your trip around Europe, than rushing around without actually
                        seeing much. And then, you can always plan another trip to discover
                        some
                        other cities you want
                        to visit. It will surely take you longer, but if you have limited time to be there, is the only
                        way to
                        really
                        see, discover, and enjoy Europe. It is a magical unique destination, and believe me, every city
                        is worth it!

                                You can choose among a Hotel, a Hostel, an apartment or even a room. Here are some tips
                                to help you decide, take into consideration the comments of previous guest, search the
                                reputation of your expected host or hotel, check on the neighborhood you are planning to
                                stay at. In some cities, it could even really help you to find a place close to the
                                train
                                station! On the other hand, you should also review the booking and payment terms of
                                course, and
                                consider the exchange rate. One last thing you might consider,
                                it is if this is your first time there or if you are returning to an old destination

                                that appealing, we urge you not to knock it until you try it.

                                <strong> Fish and chips in England, </strong> It is believed that fish and chips first
                                appeared on British shores in the 1860s and at one point, there were as many as 35,000
                                shops dedicated to this local dish!

                                <strong> Herring in The Netherlands, </strong> This is often served as a snack,
                                sometimes plain or with cut pickles and onions. According to the locals, the best way to
                                eat the herring is to grab it by the tail and hold it over your mouth.

                                <strong> Cheese fondue in Switzerland,</strong> Traditionally made from a melted
                                combination of Emmental and Gruyere cheeses, the fondue is served in a communal pot.
                                Participants will then dip pieces of bread into the mix, using a long-stemmed fork.
                                Cheese fondue was designated one of the country’s national dishes in the 1930s

                                <strong> Paella in Spain, </strong> Choosing a famous dish from Spain can be hard as
                                there is just so much choice. Tortilla Española, gazpacho and patatas bravas are just a
                                few of the standout names. However, none of these generates quite the international
                                adoration as paella does.

                                <strong> Pizza in Italy, </strong> Although pizza is a popular food all over the world,
                                no one makes it quite like the Italians. It is believed that the earliest pizzas (which
                                resemble what we think of as pizza today anyway) were created by the Neapolitans
                            </p>

                                <strong> Currywurst in Germany,</strong> This simple yet tasty fast food is a must try
                                for visitors to the country, especially after a heavy night on the town. The dish
                                essentially combines two of the finest ingredients to grace this earth: chips and
                                sausage. And to top it off, a delicious curry flavoured ketchup.

                                <strong> Waffles in Belgium, </strong> There are two main types of waffles from Belgium,
                                the Brussels waffle or the Liège waffle. The Brussels waffle is usually rectangular and
                                comes with sweet toppings, whereas the Liège waffle is usually oval and made with a
                                brioche type dough.

                                <strong> Haggis in Scotland, </strong> This savoury pudding containing sheep offal is
                                mashed together, before being stuffed into the animal’s stomach. We’ll admit, it sounds
                                pretty gross but haggis is actually pretty tasty. Those looking for a traditional
                                Scottish experience will be pleased to hear that the dish is served year-round in many
                                eating establishments and even makes an appearance in the country’s fish and chip shops.

                                <strong> Pastel de Nata in Portugal, </strong> Served fresh from the oven with a dusting

                                <strong> Trdelník in Prague, </strong> Is a kind of spit cake. It is made from rolled
                                dough that is wrapped around a stick, then grilled and topped with sugar and walnut mix.
                                And it is served with icecream inside!

                                <strong> Budapest, </strong> The capital of Hungary, is considered by many to be the
                                "Paris of the East." Not only is this beautiful city one of the most culturally
                                important metropolises in Eastern Europe, it's also home to numerous UNESCO World
                                Heritage Sites

                                <strong> Dubrovnik, </strong> The 'Pearl of the Adriatic', situated on the Dalmatian
                                coast, became an important Mediterranean sea power from the 13th century onwards.
                                Although severely damaged by an earthquake in 1667, Dubrovnik managed to preserve its
                                beautiful Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque churches, monasteries, palaces and fountains.
                                Damaged again in the 1990s by armed conflict, it is now the focus of a major restoration
                                programme co-ordinated by UNESCO.

                                <strong> Denmark, </strong>The city's many charms have become apparent to a global
                                audience, particularly in recent years. Scandinavia's "European" wing boasts glorious

                                precedence over the car and is arguably the best way to explore this compact,

                                <strong> Athens, </strong> Did you know that many theories indicate that philosophy was

                                a walk and leave the city center to visit the Athens’ seaside, its restaurants and fish
                                markets or take refuge in the green oasis of the" National Gardens"; 16 hectares of pure
                                nature await you in the heart of the Greek capital. You will love to stroll with them
