                        Known as the Big Apple, this is a city that will leave you completely marvelous: a cosmopolitan
                        city, crowed everywhere, with so many cool places to visit and enjoy, always growing and
                        evolving, with big iconic landmarks and towering skyscrapers. It is a city where you can
                        experience a vibrant culture all around, with awesome neighborhoods and boroughs to walk and
                        discover.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The city's twinkling lights and chaotic corners also invite you to embrace every New York
                        minute, explore every place and create your own urban adventure. There are endless ways to spend
                        your time in the city that never sleeps, but before you leave, stop and look around, because
                        what is there today will be transformed into something bigger and better tomorrow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> Now, when it is the best moment to visit this wonderful city? </strong>
                        The best time to visit New York is anytime. Each season the city offers visitors plenty of
                        reasons to visit. Early fall offers crisp breezes, bright sun and comfortable temperatures while
                        late fall and winter make merry with the Thanksgiving Day Parade at Macy’s and holiday
                        decorations. Christmas is for sure a magic time to visit, if you want to submerge yourself into
                        a city fully decorated and find the spirit of Christmas everywhere you go. Among many others,
                        Rockefeller Center with its outdoor ice rink is an unforgettable experience. However, it is
                        winter, and it might snow every day, which will complicate a little bit getting out
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have been there in September and in March, spring and autumn, and I can say it is a completely
                        different city. Spring is glorious and New Yorkers celebrate the thaw by taking to the streets,
                        shopping at outdoor markets. In summer days parks are full of people enjoying the green places
                        of the city as well as the walk paths along the river. Restaurants set their tables outside in
                        some neighborhoods and the atmosphere will really make you believe that sleeping is no longer
                        necessary.

                        <strong>How to get around the city of New York? </strong>
                        The best way to get around New York City is on foot, as traffic is heavy. That said, the subway
                        system is a convenient option too, and it extends throughout Manhattan and into the other New
                        York boroughs. Buses are another affordable way to get around, but keep in mind they traverse
                        streets clogged with weaving cars and cabs, so it could delay a little to get where you want to
                        get, but, since you are a tourist, you can just relax and enjoy every second there
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> What to do and see in New York? </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everything! It is a city to make no plans, to walk around, to discover, to get lost, to see
                        everything, to visit every museum, to enter every department store, every place is
                        unforgettable, even if you are not a city lover, this city is so incredible that you will end up
                        not wanting to leave!

                                It will mainly depend on many things, such as your budget, the duration of your stay,
                                the kind of experience you are looking for, if you are in a group or in a solo trip, the
                                weather in your destination, the size of the city you are visiting, and so on.

                                You can choose among a Hotel, a Hostel, an apartment or even a room. Here are some tips
                                to help you decide, take into consideration the comments of previous guest, search the
                                reputation of your expected host or hotel, check on the neighborhood you are planning to
                                stay at, find out traveling extra costs you could need to afford is you plan to stay in
                                a
                                faraway place, and in this case, you could maybe even consider renting a car and
                                evaluate it cost. You should also review the booking and payment terms of course, and
                                consider the exchange rate. One last thing you might consider,
                                it is if this is your first time there or if you are returning to an old destination
