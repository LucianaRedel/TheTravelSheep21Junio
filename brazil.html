                <p> Containing a stunning coastline, the north area has beaches with completely different
                    characteristics
                    from each other. Some are located in busy neighborhoods with lots of bars and beach clubs on the
                    waterfront, while others are very secluded and can only be reached through trails in the middle of
                    the woods or by boat. And then there are those beaches that are perfect to practice water sports
                    including, among others, windsurfing, surfing, kitesurfing, and diving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="negrita"> Maragogi, </span> Is a resort town on the Atlantic coast in eastern Brazil.
                    It
                    is known for its long beaches such as Burgalhau, near the mangrove-lined Dos Paus River. Offshore
                    coral reefs and sandbars have created a shallow lagoon, which acts as a natural pool. South of
                    Maragogi is São Bento, a fishing village with a palm-edged beach. The coast here is part of the
                    Coral Coast protected area, which is rich in flora and fauna.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="negrita"> Recife, </span> Welcoming and full of life, the city of Recife has beautiful
                    beaches with clear blue
                    waters. But it is not only natural beauty that makes it so special. The city’s historic monuments,
                    local music, and the people’s hospitality also help in making it so attractive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The harmonious contrast between the monuments in Recife Antigo (the old town) and the modern
                    buildings in the business center is just one of the city’s attractions. Visitors cannot resist the

                                <strong> Canjica, </strong> Is a bowl of whole pieces of white corn mixed with milk, a
                                splash of coconut milk and condensed milk to make a creamy, enviable dessert with
                                sprinkles of cinnamon on top.

                                <strong> Açaí, </strong> Try it plain as sorbet, or ask for banana, strawberry or
                                granola
                                to be added in to take it to a whole new level of tastiness

                                <strong> Pão de Queijo, </strong> This is so much more than just cheese bread. Made with
                                cassava flour so it is totally gluten-free, these little puffs are crispy on the
                                outside, squidgy on the inside and filled with cheesy flavor
                            </p>

                                <strong> Beijinho de Coco, </strong> The name literally translates to little kiss of
                                coconut, which fits perfectly with this mouth-sized dessert. It’s made with condensed
                                milk and butter mixed together before being rolled up into little balls and covered in
                                coconut flakes

                                <strong> Farofa, </strong> Is unique to Brazil and its taste and significance is hard to
                                understand without actually trying it. It is basically fried tapioca flour mixed with
                                small pieces of fried bacon and served alongside rice and beans
                            </p>

                                <strong> Feijoada, </strong> Is one of the Brazilian main dishes you can find the most
                                and is eaten in every corner of the country. It’s a pot of black beans cooked with
                                chunks of meat, although the truly traditional feijoadas cook it with pig’s ears,
                                trotters and other parts. It’s served with fried kale mixed with bacon bits, rice,
                                farofa (here, farofa works so well to absorb those last bits of bean sauce) and a slice
                                of orange to flavor.

                                <strong> Prawn skewer, </strong>Fresh prawns on a skewer is the number one food to be
                                spotted on the beaches in Brazil

                                <strong> Mandioca frita, </strong>Fried cassava is a popular choice in Brazil as an
                                alternative to chips. They’re chunky, crispy and delicious, not to mention a healthier
                                option than normal french fries.

                                <strong> Beer, </strong> All over Brazil, most of the places that serve beer will do so
                                in smaller glasses that are usually smaller than the ½ pint glasses. The idea behind
                                this makes sense as most areas in Brazil experience heat that is extreme, and the larger
                                glasses warm up faster

                                <strong> Caipirinha, </strong> Is Brazil's national cocktail, made with cachaça, sugar,
                                and lime. The drink is prepared by mixing the fruit and the sugar together, then adding
                                the liquor. This can be made in a single large glass to be shared among people, or in a
                                larger jar, from which it is served in individual glasses.

                                Brazil is somewhat safe, but you should take precaution on the streets of major cities,
                                and after dark. Be wary of pickpockets and bag snatching and keep your valuables safely
                                by your side. Never carry all your money in one place or leave your valuables in plain
                                sight in a car or at a beach when swimming.

                            <p> Don't assume everyone speaks your language. Many tourists that arrive in Brazil are
                                under the false impression that if they know a bit of Spanish they will be fine, yet
                                Portuguese is official language in this country. </p>
                            <p> While Portuguese and Spanish may be fairly similar, this does not mean that speaking
                                Spanish will automatically make traveling around Brazil easier.
                                In addition, the English language is not widely spoken. However, some residents in São
                                Paulo along with a few of the </p>
                            <p>
                                When in Brazil always wait for every car to stop completely before you decide to cross a
                                road, regardless of whether there is a green man telling you are allowed to cross.

                                Subways in the main cities offer carriages for women only, yet this rule is only
                                applicable during the peak hours from 6am to 9 am and 5 pm to 8 pm from Monday to
                                Friday.
                                If men enter one of these carriages, they could face a fine of as much as R$1,000 which
                                translates into $320USD. Outside the peak hours, both women and men are permitted to use
                                these carriages.

                                It’s often assumed that South America is a budget-friendly place to visit and in
                                general, this is an accurate assumption. However, a few of the main cities like Rio de
                                Janeiro and São Paulo can be costly, especially in wealthier neighborhoods like Leblon
                                and Ipanema which are also some of the top tourist areas.

                                Drinking tap water in Brazil is safe but due to its treatment process, the taste is not
                                very good. Therefore, most Brazilians choose to drink bottled water instead of tap
                                water.
